# CaesarCipher
Caesar Cipher encoder and decoder

Use left and right arrows to rotate the outer circle and change the shift of the cipher. Type in the left hand boxes to encode or decode.
Copy the right hand boxes to do the opposite.

I had originally started out making something else in the Unity project and changed it, which is why the project name doesn't quite make sense.
